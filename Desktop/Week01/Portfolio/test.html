  The speculation surrounding player movements in the PSL is rife, with the 2014/15 PSL season in its final week.
  The transfer window is upon us and the respective clubs are planning to bolster their squads for the season ahead.
  In this week’s edition of Soccer Laduma we assess who Kaizer Chiefs want at the club, should Coach Stuart Baxter part ways with the Soweto giants. In addition, we look into contract negotiations with some of the team’s players.
  We have news on possible exits from Orlando Pirates as the club plans for the new season. In addition, the crew investigates the latest dealings at Mamelodi Sundowns. Indications are that a number of players are unhappy with their situations at Chloorkop.
  In addition, we have news on Tokelo Rantie and Kwanda Mngonyama.
  What do you want to read about in this week’s Siyagobhoza? Let me know and I will get the crew to investigate for you.
  Cheers, Eddie
